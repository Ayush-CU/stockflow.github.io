						<h4>What Are Stock Charts</h4>
						<p> A chart is a graphical representation of price and volume movements of a stock over a certain period of time. In the graphical chart, the X-axis represents the time period and the Y-axis represents the price movement. The time period can vary from intra-day to even a few months or more. There are many types of charts that are used for technical analysis. However, the four types that are most common are line chart, bar chart, point and figure chart and candlestick chart.</p>

						<h4>What Are Trend Line and Trend Length And Their Roles</h4>
						<p><b>Trend Lines: </b>A trend line is a straight line that connects all the tops or bottoms in stock charts with each other. Trend lines are essential because trends are sometimes not so-clearly visible in technical charts. How often we see zigzag patches! They make stock analysis tricky.</p>
						<p><b>Trend Length: </b>When analysing technical charts, it is important to not only spot trends, but also predict the length of these trends. We know that primary trends are the longest lasting and bring about the most radical movement in stock prices. A decisive move in a stock price, for a sustained period will only come if the trend is strong and enduring. Minor trends and, in some cases even secondary trends, are unable to cause such a meaningful impact. They may only pass off as a flash in the pan. The longevity of a stock trend can be predicted by using patterns in the charts. One can start off with an analysis of trend lines themselves. If trend lines suggest that each time the stock price rises to a higher level before falling, it is suggestive of an uptrend.</p>

						<h4>Types Of Charts</h4>
						<p><ul type="square">
						<li><b>Line charts </b>A line chart is probably the most common type of chart. This chart tracks the closing prices of the stock over a specific period. Each closing price point is represented by a dot. And all the dots are connected by lines to get the graphical representation. While it is considered to be quite simplistic (compared to other chart types), a line chart helps traders to spot trends in the price movement. However, since it tracks closing prices, it does not offer much information regarding intraday price movements.</li>
						<li><b>Bar charts </b>A bar chart is quite similar to a line chart. However, it offers much more information. Instead of a dot, each plot point in the graph is represented by a vertical line. This line has two horizontal lines extending from both the sides. The top part of the vertical line represents the highest price at which the stock had traded during the day. Similarly, the lower part represents the lowest traded price. The left extension represents the price at which the stock opened while the right extension represents the closing price for the day.</li>
						<li><b>Candlestick charts </b>Candlestick charts are very popular among technical analysts. They offer a great deal of information in a very precise manner. As the name suggests, the price movements for each day are represented in the shape of a candlestick. It is similar to a bar chart because it represents the four data points: high, low, open and close. While bar charts give volatility information only for a single trading day, candlestick charts can offer this information for a much larger time period. In addition, the candlesticks come in different colours based on the price movements. A falling candlestick is generally represented by a black or red body while a rising candlestick is represented by a white or clear body.</li>
						<li><b>Renko Chart  </b>A Japanese invention, Renko charts, one of the major types of charts in technical analysis, focus only on price changes and use price bricks to represent a fixed price move. They filter out minor price movements which make it easier to spot trends in prices. Also, this feature makes the chart appearance more uniform. A Renko chart technical analysis is pretty effective in identifying support and resistance levels. You get a trading signal when there is a change in the direction of trend and the bricks alternate colours.</li>
						<li><b>Heikin Ashi Chart  </b>Heikin Ashi is another type of popular technical chart that originated in Japan is quite similar to candlestick chart. With this chart, you can visualise the uptrend and downtrend quite clearly. When there are continuous green HA handles without lower shadow, it’s a reflection of a strong trend.</li>
						<li><b>Point & Figure Chart  </b>One of the common types of chart in technical analysis, Point and Figure Chart using vertical rows of X’s and O’s. When price of a share goes up, it’s indicated in the row of X’s. On the other hand, when it goes down, the same is indicated by the vertical row of O’s. This chart for technical analysis is easy to plot and the patterns are easy to follow. A disciplined method of identifying current and emerging trends, Point & Figure Chart can help you in easy determination of entry and exit points.</li>

						<h4>What Are Limitation of A Balance Sheet</h4>
						<p>The balance sheet is an invaluable piece of information for investors and analysts; however, it does have some drawbacks. Since it is just a snapshot in time, it can only use the difference between this point in time and another single point in time in the past. Because it is static, many financial ratios draw on data included in both the balance sheet and the more dynamic income statement and statement of cash flows to paint a fuller picture of what's going on with a company's business.</p>

						<h4>How To Read Stock Market Charts Pattern</h4>
						<p><ul type="square">
						<li><b>Identify the chart: </b>Identify the charts and look at the top where you will find a ticker designation or symbol which is a short alphabetic identifier of a company. It is important to have a correct symbol while looking for the company’s information.</li>
						<li><b>Choose a time window: </b>This can be done on a daily, weekly monthly or yearly basis; depending on where you are accessing the chart you can choose the view. Looking at different timescale will help in identifying longer and shorter-term trends and check on consolidation. Remember and note the price on any given day and look for consolidations in the days that follow and check whether they form above or below the price.</li>
						<li><b>Note the summary key: </b>You must also check the summary key as it will give you the key information from the chart in numerical values that you can read quickly. The summary must at least give you the latest price, the price moving averages and the volume traded.</li>
						<li><b>Track the prices:  </b>The chart is divided into two sections upper and smaller lower which guides on the prices. The upper part tracks the changes in the price of stock over the period. The prices are often shown with different colors like if the stock closed up on a particular day, the marker may be black. Whereas the price at which the stock closed may be marked in red.</li>
						<li><b>Note the volume traded:  </b>In the bottom, you will find the volume of stock traded. It will help to determine when there is particular momentum, positive or negative, in the market with color-coded bars. The color-coding is not fixed therefore requires careful reading. The color refers to the up and down of closing price with the previous day closing price.</li>
						<li><b>Look at the moving averages:  </b>It is a calculation of the stock average price of a period of time that is constantly adjusted as time goes by, it is a key tool in stock analysis. In charts, these are generally indicated by lines cutting across the chart. It can help in identifying a trend pattern but there may be some lag as they refer to past prices. </li>
						</ul>
